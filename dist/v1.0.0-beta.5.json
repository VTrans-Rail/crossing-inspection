Each of these type families have a set of weights and styles, defined by their application. For example, Avenir Next has more weights than Frutiger family, reflecting its role as primary UI face, and heavy lifting header face.</p>\\n<p>The typographic palette for Calcite Web differs slightly from the official Esri branding document. All typefaces are examined in detail below.</p>\\n<p>Calcite Web provides a set of weights for each typeface. These are used by either using the helper class in html, or writing sass to include the mixin, or extending the helper class. The available weights for each face are below. Proper care has been taken to ensure that all type systems used by Calcite avoid faux-bold and faux-italics styled by the browser.</p>\\n<p>By default, Calcite Web expects font files to be located at <code>../</code>.

This variable is used for any measurement on the vertical axis in the page, including the <a href=\\\"../grid/#leader-and-trailer\\\">leader and trailer grid helper classes</a> and padding for <a href=\\\"../components/#buttons\\\">components like buttons</a> which use standard measurements like <code>3/$baseline</code> and <code>2/$baseline</code>.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"proportional-scales\\\">Proportional Scales</h3>\\n<p>Text sizes are defined by a simple <a href=\\\"http://alistapart.com/article/more-meaningful-typography\\\">modular scale</a>. The scale is defined by two base sizes for type - body at 1rem and small at 0.95rem - and extrapolates a series of larger type sizes based on a single ratio; 1.25, or a major third interval. All type sizes are <a href=\\\"http://snook.ca/archives/html_and_css/font-size-with-rem\\\">set in rems</a>, which have <a href=\\\"http://caniuse.com/#feat=rem\\\">more than acceptable browser support</a>.

For example, to remove browser specific styling for a ui element, use:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"lang-scss\\\">@include appearance(none);\\n</code></pre>\\n<h4 id=\\\"box-sizing\\\">Box-Sizing</h4>\\n<p>Set the <code>box-sizing</code> property for all browsers (with browser prefixes):</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"lang-scss\\\">@include box-sizing(border-box);\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Valid values are <code>content-box</code>, <code>border-box</code>, and <code>inherit</code>.</p>\\n<h4 id=\\\"box-shadow\\\">Box-Shadow</h4>\\n<p>Set the <code>box-shadow</code> property for all browsers (with browser prefixes):</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"lang-scss\\\">@include box-shadow(border-box);\\n</code></pre>\\n<h4 id=\\\"calc\\\">Calc</h4>\\n<p>Shorthand for setting a property to use a <code>calc</code> value. Pass the property you&#39;d like to set, then the value you&#39;d like to use:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"lang-scss\\\">@include calc(width, &#39;100px - 10%&#39;);\\n</code></pre>\\n<h4 id=\\\"clearfix\\\">Clearfix</h4>\\n<p>Applies the framework-standard clear for floated elements:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"lang-scss\\\">@include clearfix();\\n</code></pre>\\n<h4 id=\\\"keyframes\\\">Keyframes</h4>\\n<p>For creating animations, you can use the <code>keyframes</code> mixin. This mixin accepts an animation name. Then inside the mixin, write your animation as a content block:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"lang-scss\\\">@include keyframes(ANIMATION_NAME){\\n  0%   { background-color: #ffccf2; }\\n  100% { background-color: #ccffff; }\\n};\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Now you can use the <a href=\\\"#animation\\\">animation mixin</a> as a named animation like this:</p>\\n<pre><code>.animation-class {\\n  @include animation( @include animation(ANIMATION_NAME 200ms ease-in);)\\n}\\n</code></pre><h4 id=\\\"placeholder\\\">Placeholder</h4>\\n<p>Wraps the wide array of input placeholder selectors across browsers.</p>\\n<pre><code>@include placeholder(&#39;color&#39;, $dark-blue);\\n</code></pre><h4 id=\\\"prefixer\\\">Prefixer</h4>\\n<p>This is one of the most flexible mixins in the library. Use it to add browser prefixes to a property:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"lang-scss\\\">@include prefixer(margin-end, 5%, webkit moz spec);\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>In this way you can prefix any property. Adding the <code>spec</code> as the last argument will also output the property <em>without</em> a prefix.</p>\\n<h4 id=\\\"respond-to\\\">Respond To</h4>\\n<p>The <code>respond-to</code> mixin adds media queries for use in responsive design. The mixin accepts three arguments: maximum size, minimum size, and type (screen, print, etc). You can pass just the first out of convenience. This mixin works well with the <a href=\\\"../sass#breakpoints\\\">breakpoint variables</a>:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"lang-scss\\\">.my-div {\\n  @include respond-to($small){\\n    padding: 1rem;\\n  }\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>This will compile to the following css:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"lang-css\\\">@media screen and (max-width: 480px) {\\n  .my-div {\\n    padding: 1rem;\\n  }\\n}\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>You can assemble more complicated media queries by using both min and max:</p>\\n<pre><code>@include respond-to($large, $medium) { ... }\\n</code></pre><p>This will add styles that only appear <em>between</em> the <code>$medium</code> and <code>$large</code> screen sizes.</p>\\n<h4 id=\\\"transform\\\">Transform</h4>\\n<p>The CSS transform property lets you modify the coordinate space of the CSS visual formatting model. Using it, elements can be translated, rotated, scaled, and skewed according to the values set. <code>transform</code>, <code>transform-origin</code>, and <code>transform-style</code> all add the necessary browser prefixes for interacting with their respective transform properties.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"lang-scss\\\">@include transform(translateY(50px));\\n@include transform(scale(0.9) rotate(-3deg));\\n@include transform-origin(center top);\\n@include transform-style(preserve-3d);\\n</code></pre>\\n<h4 id=\\\"transition\\\">Transition</h4>\\n<p>This mixin provides a shorthand syntax and supports multiple transitions.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"lang-scss\\\">@include transition(all 2.0s ease-in-out);\\n@include transition(opacity 1.0s ease-in 0s, width 2.0s ease-in 2s);\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Or you can use the individual transition properties:</p>\\n<pre><code>@include transition-property(transform);\\n@include transition-duration(1.0s);\\n@include transition-timing-function(ease-in);\\n@include transition-delay(0.5s);\\n</code></pre><h4 id=\\\"transition-prefixed\\\">Transition Prefixed</h4>\\n<p>To transition vendor-prefixed properties, e.g. <code>-webkit-transform</code> and <code>-moz-transform</code>, there is an additional convinience <code>transition-prefixed()</code> mixin:</p>\\n<pre><code>@include transition-prefixed(transform3d(0,0,0) 200ms linear);\\n</code></pre><p>This will generate vendor prefixed properties <em>and</em> values.</p>\\n<h4 id=\\\"visibility\\\">Visibility</h4>\\n<p>The visibility mixins change the <code>visibility</code> property. This is useful for removing and adding elements at certain breakpoints or with certain class names. No arguments are passed. Invisible sets <code>visibility: hidden</code> on the object, leaving in the in document flow, but removing it from view. <code>hide()</code> will completely remove the item with <code>display:none</code>.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"lang-scss\\\">@include hide();\\n@include invisible();\\n@include visible();\\n</code></pre>\\n\""},{"_id":"3a6b6c9f-9108-4546-a8fe-2dcbca936b11","name":"Overview","slug":"overview","tags":["calcite-web","web","Overview","Interactive Patterns","JavaScript","javascript"],"sort_order":0,"group":"Interactive Patterns","LastModified":1454367251782,"description":"\"<p>Calcite Web includes a small JavaScript library. <code>calcite-web.js</code> is a lightweight and dependency-free library made to enable interactive behaviors for certain <a href=\\\"../patterns/\\\">patterns</a> and <a href=\\\"../components\\\">components</a>.</p>\\n<p>Currently, the following components and patterns rely on <code>calcite-web.js</code>:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"../components/#dropdowns\\\">Dropdowns</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"../patterns/#modals\\\">Modals</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"../patterns/#tabs\\\">Tabs</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"../patterns/#accordions\\\">Accordions</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"../patterns/#drawers\\\">Drawers</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"../patterns/#expanding-nav\\\">Expanding Nav</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3 id=\\\"loading-calcite-as-a-module\\\">Loading Calcite as a Module</h3>\\n<p>If you don&#39;t use a module loader (you probably should...), Calcite will be available as <code>window.calcite</code>.
