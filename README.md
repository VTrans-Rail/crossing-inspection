# crossing-inspection

This is a web application designed to for use by Vermont transportation professionals that work with public railroad crossings. The application allows the user to find crossings by searching for Department of Transporation Number (a unique ID), County, Town, Road, or Condition. The user also has the option to navigate the map to find the crossing of interest. Once a crossing is selected, the application sends a query to the database and serves relevant data and picture attachments to the user.

The bulk of the application is built on Esri's ArcGIS API for Javascript, Grid forms, and Bootstrap.
